- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, This is Mehdi Astaraki.
- ðŸ‘€ I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in medical image processing and analysis. My research focuses on developing, evaluating, validating, and deploying rule-based, deep learning and machine learning models for applications in oncology, including diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning of brain tumors, lung tumors, bone metastases, head & neck cancers, and lymph node involvement. My methodological expertise lies in supervised learning, representation learning,  and federated learning techniques, all applied to volumetric images e.g, MRI, CT, and PET.
